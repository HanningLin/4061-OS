-The purpose of your program
 -Our program read a DAG text file and built the full graph data structure. 
 Then the program read and decrypts leaf files from the Input-directory and...
 saves the decrypted version into the Output-Directory. 
 The program can spawn threads to do the aggregation of intermeidate directories,
 and store the aggregated result files from their children. 
 The root directory contains one folder and log file which lists all our excution steps.

-How to compile the program
 -You can simply use <make> in the shell to compile the program
-How to use the program from the syntax
 -./votecounter DAG.txt <input_dir> <output_dir> <num_threads>
 - OR:./votecounter DAG.txt <input_dir> <output_dir>
